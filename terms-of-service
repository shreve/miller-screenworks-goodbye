store, you&#39;re entering into a binding agreement described in the terms of service. These terms tend to be the most dense page of any website. Knowing what&#39;s involved in this agreement, however, is important for both parties involved.</p>

<p>To ease your frustration, we&#39;ve tried to create the shortest and most clear document possible.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This website is operated by Miller Screenworks, Inc. Throughout the site, the terms “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Miller Screenworks, Inc.</p>

<p>We offer this website, including all information, tools, and services available from this site to you, the user, conditioned upon your acceptance of all terms, conditions, policies and notices stated here.

Acceptance of these terms also includes acceptance of the information in our <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and our <a href="/returns-and-exchanges">Return Policy</a>. These Terms of Service apply to all users of the site, including browsers, customers, and merchants.</p>
